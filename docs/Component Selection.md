__Choice: Option #2: Gikfun Tactile Surface Mount Push Button__ <br>
__Rationale:__ This option was selected due to the extreme amount of customizability available. Considering the team's STEM exhibit works closely with color recognition, it was important to select something that works well within the theme. Also, these buttons funtion to provide excellent tactile feedback while offering a level of interactivity other options cannot. While it's true that this option was the most expensive, it remains in the range of budget.
