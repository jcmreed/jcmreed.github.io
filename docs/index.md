## __My Role in the Project__
My role in this project was to design and implement the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for our interactive STEM exhibit. The purpose of the HMI was to give exhibit-goers an intuitive way to interact with the system and control the sorting mechanism. A more detailed overview of the complete system can be found on [my team's webpage.](https://asu-egr314-2025-s-201.github.io/)

My interface was built around three physical pushbuttons that allow users to navigate through a selection menu and confirm their choices. Feedback and instructions were provided via a compact OLED LCD display, allowing users to see their input in real-time and follow along with the quiz-like experience.

In addition to managing user interaction, I was responsible for UART-based communication between my subsystem and the rest of the team. More specifically, the most important messages I sent were structured serial messages to the actuator subsystem to trigger the motor based on the userâ€™s choice. My design ensured that all outgoing messages followed our predefined communication protocol, enabling seamless interaction between the user interface and the rest of the system.
