Please refer to my team's webpage for a more detailed descripton of the product. My goal is to allow the user to navigate through the interface with three seperate buttons for movement and selection. Inputs should be reflected on the interface, which is done through a small OLED LCD display. In regards to my communication responsibilities, I am responsible for sending UART commands to my team members in charge of actuators and internet as the stepper motor should move on user command and display information on a mobile device respectively.</p>"},{"location":"Component%20Selection/#table-1-selecting-a-pushbutton","title":"Table 1: Selecting a Pushbutton","text":"Potential Solutions Pros Cons  Option #1: PTS636SM43SMTR LFS Surface Mount Push Button ($0.23) link to product - Good PCB Contact  - Tactile  - Inexpensive - Long Shipping Time  - Small for User Interactivity  Option #2: Gikfun Tactile Surface Mount Push Button ($8.68)  link to product - Fun and Colorful for Exhibit  - Tactile  - Fast Shipping - Expensive  - Comes in Bulk  - Must Reorientate Pins for PCB  Option #3: K8WH41G LFS Tactile Surface Mount Push Button w/ LED ($6.45)  link to product - LED for Exhibit Experience  - Tactile - Long Shipping Time  - Extra Pins for LED Control  - Must Buy Other Buttons for Different LED Color <p>Choice: Option #2: Gikfun Tactile Surface Mount Push Button Rationale: This option was selected due to the extreme amount of customizability available. Considering the team's STEM exhibit works closely with color recognition, it was important to select something that works well within the theme. Also, these buttons funtion to provide excellent tactile feedback while offering a level of interactivity other options cannot. While it's true that this option was the most expensive, it remains in the range of budget.</p>"},{"location":"Component%20Selection/#table-2-selecting-an-oled-screen","title":"Table 2: Selecting an OLED Screen","text":"Potential Solutions Pros Cons  Option #1: Songhe 0.96inch OLED LCD Display Board (~$2.00 per board) link to product - I2C Serial Communication  - 5 Pack  - Provided from ASU - No Price Listed  - Small Resolution  - Might be Difficult for Users to See  Option #2: Winstar Graphic LCD Display Module ($7.02)  link to product - I2C Serial Communication  - Easy Communication w/ ESP32  - Small Resolution  - Not Provided from ASU  - Might be Difficult for Users to See  Option #3: HiLetgo 0.91inch I2C Serial OLED LCD Display ($6.49)  link to product - I2C Serial Communication  - Rectangular Display  - Fast Shipping - Small Resolution  - Not Provided from ASU <p>Choice: Option #1: Songhe 0.96inch OLED LCD Display Board Rationale: Overall, all solutions in this table were very similar and varied only by price and display size. The reason option #1 was selected was due to the fact that ASU provides the screen, which saves money and shipping time. Familiarity with this device will be gained through in-class labs as well.</p>"},{"location":"Component%20Selection/#table-3-selecting-a-voltage-regulator","title":"Table 3: Selecting a Voltage Regulator","text":"Potential Solutions Pros Cons  Option #1: AP2114H-3.3TRG1 Linear Voltage Regulator ($0.61)  link to product - Meets Requirements  - Inexpensive  - Compact Design - Requires External Components  - 6V Input  - Linear, not Adjustable  Option #2: L6981C33DR - Buck Switching Regulator ($2.80)  link to product - High Efficiency  - Adjustable and Fixed Capabilities  - Compact Design - Requires External Components  - Expensive for Regulator   Option #3: SC189ZSKTRT - 3.3V Buck Switching Regulator ($1.89)  link to product - High Efficiency  - Inexpensive  - Compact Design - Requires External Components  - Soldering Might be Difficult  <p>Choice: Option #2: L6981C33DR - 3.3V Buck Switching Regulator Rationale: This solution was selected as it meets all project requirements with high efficiency as well. While it does require extra components, the datasheet helps identify a proper setup for good results. Even though this option is expensive for a regulator, this is a necessary tradeoff to take as it implements functionality better than other options. </p>"},{"location":"Component%20Selection/#table-4-selecting-a-power-supply","title":"Table 4: Selecting a Power Supply","text":"Potential Solutions Pros Cons  Option #1: WR9HD1333CCP-F(R6B) - 9V 12 W AC/DC External Wall Mount ($3.94)  link to product - Barrel Jack Output  - Inexpensive  - 1.33A (Sufficient for ESP32, Might Need More Room for Other Peripherals)  - Long Shipping Time  Option #2: WSU090-2000-13 - 9V 18 W AC/DC External Wall Mount ($12.15)   link to product - Barrel Jack Output  - 2A Supply  - Expensive  - Long Shipping Time  - Bulky Design  Option #3: VEL12US090-US-JA - 9V 12 W AC/DC External Wall Mount ($12.17)  link to product - Barrel Jack Output  - Slim Design  - Expensive  - Long Shipping Time  - 1.28A Supply <p>Choice: Option #2: WSU090-2000-13 - 9V 18 W AC/DC External Wall Mount Rationale: Other options simply need to be able to supply at least 1.5A as the voltage regulator chosen above has an output of 1.5A. In order for every component to function up to their potential and eliminate risk, this wall mount was selected.
